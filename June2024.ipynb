    "1. **Independence**:  \n",
    "   The observations (weight changes) for the chickens in each group are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Equal Variance**:  \n",
    "   It is stated in the problem that the variance is the same in all treatment groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Normality**:  \n",
    "   The weight changes within each group should be approximately normally distributed.  \n",
    "   *(Note: ANOVA is robust to mild deviations from normality for large sample sizes, like 75 per group.)*\n",
    "\n",
